THE PROBLEM: it is sometimes very difficult to tell how to optimally select courses to satisfy as many distribution requirements at once.
THE SOLUTION: THIS! If you run this python program in the command line it will generate a list of courses that you can use to streamline the registration process. Currently it only works with Arts and Sciences but I may update it in the future.
